Data Science Internship Portfolio – CodSoft

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio at CodSoft! This repository showcases a curated collection of projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Each project demonstrates the practical application of data science concepts to real-world scenarios.
📘 1. Iris Flower Classification

Description:
A classic machine learning project using the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements. Implemented supervised learning algorithms and visualized decision boundaries to understand classification patterns.
📊 2. Sales Prediction Using Python

Description:
Developed a linear regression model to predict business sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. Included steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
🛡️ 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description:
Built a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Tackled class imbalance using undersampling techniques and applied logistic regression to achieve reliable classification performance. The project emphasizes the importance of model accuracy and fraud detection sensitivity.
